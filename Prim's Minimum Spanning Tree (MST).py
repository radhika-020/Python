MST is as Minimum Spanning Tree in which all the vertices are connected with each other without forming a cycle and with minimum cost. In the MST, the very first step is to create a record for an array of vertices that is met everytime. Initially it is empty.
After creating an empty mstSet = {}, select the root node and aassign its key value with 0 and all other vertices with key values as infinite.
At the very first, select the root node, and all its adjacent vertices. If the weight of the u to v edge is less than the weight present in the key of that vertex, then update its value by w(u,v) or else leave the same. Then, select the other vertex, with least minimum cost, and repeat the same process, till the time, all the vertices are met and included in the mstSet = {}.
